# Calculator App

<h2>The objetive of this website/app was to create a simple calculator with the design of a cell phone on the center of the screen.</h2>
<h2>The code (24/7/2023) has a lot of potential for upgrades. For example: night mode, detect entrys from keyboard and scientific options.</h2>
<h2>For me it's ok because i was usefull to practice javascript logic and some css moduling</h2>
